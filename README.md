# USA-GunViolenceAnalysis
This project analyzes a comprehensive dataset of over 260,000 gun violence incidents recorded between January 2013 and March 2018. By leveraging data science techniques, we seek to identify key trends, geographic hotspots, demographic characteristics of victims and perpetrators, and potential risk factors associated with gun-related incidents.

## Methodology
1. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
- Handling missing values and inconsistent data
- Standardizing categorical variables
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Temporal trends and seasonal variations
- Geospatial mapping of hotspots
3. Statistical & Machine Learning Models
- Predictive modeling for incident severity
- Clustering analysis for hotspot detection
